## Vectorial Agency: The Kantian Turn

By **Agency**, I mean maturity and autonomy in a nearly Kantian sense—the human capacity to think and decide with intent. 
This is inherently demanding. As Kant suggested, it requires the *courage* (*“Mut”*) to use one’s own understanding.

In the digital age, it is easier to drift. 
Algorithms curate our feeds; Spotify selects our music; AI agents may soon trade our stocks or influence legal sentences. 
This is where the “vectorial” component enters: it signifies directed action.

Vectorial Agency is the refusal to let the AI operate as a black box. 
It means reclaiming the role of the captain. While the industry strives to make AI interaction frictionless, the Vectorial Agent introduces intentional friction — the act of questioning, refining, and verifying. 
It is not a skill you learn once; it is a sovereignty you defend daily.

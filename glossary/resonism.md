## Resonism
### The Framework of Interaction

I chose the neologism **Resonism** to evoke **Resonance**, **Reason**, and **Raison**. 
While the term “resonance” carries some New Age baggage, I use it in its physical sense: when two oscillations synchronize, they amplify one another.

When human intent and machine mechanics align on the same “wavelength,” the output is transformed. 
If Vectorial Agency is the prerequisite for conscious action, Resonism is the overall framework for optimal interaction. 
It is operationalized in the core principle: **Avoid Noise, Seek Resonance**
